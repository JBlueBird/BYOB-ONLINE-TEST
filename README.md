## BYOB Browser!
When I'm not working on [Jcode](https://forum.snap.berkeley.edu/t/jcode-official-forum/19524/28), I am working on other fun projects expanding my hobbies. I recently got the idea to port [BYOB](https://snap.berkeley.edu/old_site/old-byob.html) to the web, after I downloaded the program and saw it had a .image file.

The MacOS X .app file just runs the .image file, I noticed. Also, a long time ago I was experimenting with [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org/). I saw examples were .image files, and I did not think much of it, until now; when I realized that the BYOB program had a .image file.

After doing tons of research and tons of trial and error, I finally got it working on the web. (this took me like two hours). What's great is that because this is a website, any OS can run it. Linux? Not a problem. [ChromeOS](https://chromeos.google/)? Not a problem.

Even if low-memory and/or low-processing computers can't run Snap!, they can now run [BYOB](https://snap.berkeley.edu/old_site/old-byob.html) easily, even if it was NOT originally designed for their system.

This also get's around modern MacOS's error that "The developer of this app needs to update it" due to it being 34 bit, not 64 bit. (Because modern MacOS is only compatible with 64 bit, I believe)

What I'm currently working in the project: Getting the [Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_(desktop_environment)) version of BYOB to run on the web

## BYOB Browser!
When I'm not working on [Jcode](https://forum.snap.berkeley.edu/t/jcode-official-forum/19524/28), I am working on other fun projects expanding my hobbies. I recently got the idea to port [BYOB](https://snap.berkeley.edu/old_site/old-byob.html) to the web, after I downloaded the program and saw it had a .image file.

The MacOS X .app file just runs the .image file, I noticed. Also, a long time ago I was experimenting with [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org/). I saw examples were .image files, and I did not think much of it, until now; when I realized that the BYOB program had a .image file.

After doing tons of research and tons of trial and error, I finally got it working on the web. (this took me like two hours). What's great is that because this is a website, any OS can run it. Linux? Not a problem. [ChromeOS](https://chromeos.google/)? Not a problem.

Even if low-memory and/or low-processing computers can't run Snap!, they can now run [BYOB](https://snap.berkeley.edu/old_site/old-byob.html) easily, even if it was NOT originally designed for their system.

This also get's around modern MacOS's error that "The developer of this app needs to update it" due to it being 34 bit, not 64 bit. (Because modern MacOS is only compatible with 64 bit, I believe)

What I'm currently working in the project: Getting the [Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_(desktop_environment)) version of BYOB to run on the web

Features
- Pick any version of BYOB from 2.0 to 3.1.1
![Choose a version|400x40, 75%](upload://ctElrBSev9iNMksP2bjJP1zsIca.png)
- Compatible with any system, even School Chromebooks!
- Plug and play - no download needed.

[details="Click me to find out more about installing the app!"]

The BYOB app has been not working on many systems for a very long time. However, I revived this by creating a PWA app for desktops, phones, and tablets.
![The original BYOB app vs. my new BYOB app|394x208](upload://2313jj6W73n9Q1ExdivCqf5qr1I.png)
*The original BYOB app vs. my new BYOB app*

You can install this app by:

First, go to [https://jbluebird.github.io/Browser-BYOB/desktop/index.html](https://jbluebird.github.io/Browser-BYOB/desktop/index.html)

Next, follow the instructions for your browser below.
- In Safari, click share, then click add to homescreen (or add to dock, on MacOS)
- In Chrome, click the install button in the search bar

If your web browser is not in this list, [you can easily search up instructions on how to install a app in your browser of choice on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+I+install+a+web+app+on+popular+browsers&sca_esv=5ed3572dacaed608&sxsrf=AE3TifNbo24K6-4j18VzPWBNaUO7Gpu2UA%3A1749062507773&ei=a5NAaLr3LszKp84Pse3b0Qg&ved=0ahUKEwj62NzLtdiNAxVM5ckDHbH2NooQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=how+do+I+install+a+web+app+on+popular+browsers&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiLmhvdyBkbyBJIGluc3RhbGwgYSB3ZWIgYXBwIG9uIHBvcHVsYXIgYnJvd3NlcnMyBBAjGCcyBRAAGO8FMgUQABjvBTIIEAAYgAQYogRI8AdQmgJYuQVwAXgBkAEAmAF1oAG0AaoBAzEuMbgBA8gBAPgBAZgCA6ACvQHCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgIKECEYoAEYwwQYCpgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzIuMaAHtAmyBwMxLjG4B7sBwgcFMC4yLjHIBwU&sclient=gws-wiz-serp).

The BYOB app has a interface similar to the website, but different. In the new BYOB app, you can choose what version of BYOB you want to run. Here's how it looks on MacOS:

![The new BYOB app on MacOS|652x500](upload://tFXaBUR8wxmOibwdCogLvONxlIA.png)

Of course, this works on all systems that support webapps.

If you want to uninstall the Jcode webapp, look up [uninstall webapp on Google](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=5ed3572dacaed608&sxsrf=AE3TifMPQKG_EfwYmRH4jTXDmCcBbH9joQ:1749063606994&q=uninstall+web+app+on+popular+systems&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj46O_XudiNAxUPMtAFHfZSJ5AQBSgAegQIERAB&biw=1496&bih=772&dpr=2) (or your preferred browser of choice)
